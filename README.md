# Crack the Code

This game is a play on the paper game Bulls and Cows. In this rendition of the game, the player is a master of disguise who can steal any jewel desired. 
The player will have 15 tries to crack the cipher. If they complete the challenge within the specified tries, they will win and evade the authorities once again. 
If not though, they will be captured and lose all their jewels. At the end of the game, the player can choose to continue their life of crime by playing again, 
or turn over a new leaf and exit the game.


This was a collaboration project with Sam Breece and Miggie Garcia.
